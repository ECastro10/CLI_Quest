This is CLI_Quest.

I have been meaning to work on this again for a while.
I figured I can take a breather when I want to and work on
this turn based battle game.

My first goal is to solidify the battle mechanics including
computer operated opponents.
After that, then maybe create maps that the user can maneuver
through. This part is not really fleshed out though.

Stats are generated randomly within some parameters when
any player object is instantiated.

There are currently only three moves, Tackle, Slash, Taunt.

I draw heavy inspiration from the Pokemon battle mechanics
which is why the damage formula looks so similar.

Currently the battle mechanics works but only from the user
side, that is that only the user does any attacking.

No random encounters yet.
